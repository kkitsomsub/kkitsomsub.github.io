## Welcome to Kornkit Kitsomsub's Github.io Page!

Hi! Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Kornkit, or Kit for short! I am a senior studying Mathematics at New York University (NYU). Visit [this page](https://kkitsomsub.github.io/about) to learn more about me!

My current interests are in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently enrolled in *Machine Learning for Language Understanding*, *Causal Inference*, and *Projects in Programming (Stern Class)* - projects and a paper to come soon!

You can visit [this link](kkitsomsub.github.io/projects) to look at some of my past modeling projects.
