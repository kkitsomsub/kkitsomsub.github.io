# About Me

I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. I have three other siblings, two of which are my younger (fraternal) triplet siblings! 
My triplet brother studied International Business Administration at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University 
and my triplet sister is pursuing her Bachelor of Arts in Language and Culture with a focus on Spanish at Chulalongkorn 
University.


Some of my hobbies are:

* Technical & Cave Diving (Scuba Diving)
