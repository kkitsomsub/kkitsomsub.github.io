# About Me

I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. I have three other siblings, two of which are my younger (fraternal) triplet siblings! 
My triplet brother studied International Business Administration at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University 
and my triplet sister is pursuing her Bachelor of Arts in Language and Culture with a focus on Spanish at Chulalongkorn 
University.


Some of my hobbies are:

* Technical & Cave Diving (Scuba Diving)
  * I started scuba diving in 2017. As a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut and wanted to experience the feeling of weightlessness. My first underwater experience was during a school trip in a pool and I immediately knew I wanted to explore it further! 
  
  Eventually, I was exposed to technical diving by doing a sidemount and Intro-to-Cave course with a friend. Since then, I have been doing more demanding dives that require extensive planning and discpline. I later started to do deeper, decompression dives in Koh Tao, Thailand. Recently, in January 2020, I was able to finish my Full Cave certification in Tulum, Mexico. Below is a video with me in the caves as part of a conservation project, Somos Los Cenotes. The project aims to raise awareness of the existence of underwater caves in the Muyil area which are being threatened by rapid construction and urbanization of that area. The destruction of those caves, which took thousands of years to form, would be a massive loss to the area as it affects not only the ecosystem and biodiversity of Muyil but also to the tourism in that area as well and therefore it is of paramount importance that these caves are conserved!
